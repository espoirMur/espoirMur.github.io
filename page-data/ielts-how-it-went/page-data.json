While waiting for the result , I would like to share with you how it went. </p>\n<p><strong>Logistics</strong> </p>\n<p>I reached the British Council in Kigali at 8:30, 30 minutes before my test. </p>\n<p>I was  a comfortable place and they made sure all COVID preventions measure were followed strictly. </p>\n<p>Once I got inside the test room I asked the examiner if he could change my keyboard layout since I was more familiar with the AZERTY french keyboard but to my dismay the said it’s unchangeable. I was forced to use the normal English keyboard layout for the test. Although, this decreased my touching typing speed, it didn’t affect my test performance on overall except some typos I managed to correct within the timelines.</p>\n<p><strong>The tests</strong></p>\n<p>It was a computer delivered IELTS, and was divided in two parts, the first one consisted of the listening , the reading and the writing; the second one was the speaking. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/xUA7bcVPhLACfKIItG/giphy.gif\" alt=\"stressfull exam\"></p>\n<p>The <em><strong>listening test</strong></em> went smoothly as expected, beside some comprehension issues but I am sure I did well on this one. </p>\n<p>Then came <em><strong>the reading</strong></em>, this was the most challenging part, but I managed to answer all questions in one hour. As usual, they gave us three texts ,the first one was about facial recognition, a topic I am familiar with due to my Machine Learning background, the second one was about Easter Island and it Stone statues and the third one was on coaster rollers.</p>\n<p>At the end of the reading test , I took a toilet break for  3 minutes  and I resumed with the <em><strong>writing test.</strong></em></p>\n<p>In task one I got a combination of a land map and a population growth graph. With all the keyboard issues I lost 10 minutes on this test and I spent 30 minutes responding instead of 20 minutes as advised.</p>\n<p>The task two was about personal information being stored in computers. I was asked if the advantages of that practice outweighs it disadvantages. With the 30 minutes remaining, I managed to write 277 words for this topic. This one was my favorite part ,I wish I  had  more time to bombard them with everything I know about privacy and data.  I spent some time correcting the essays and the first part was over. </p>\n<p>Around midday I left the room confident that I nailed it but let us wait for the results. </p>\n<p>The <em><strong>speaking test</strong></em> started at 13:40, I was luckily to have brought a book which helped me to avoid the waiting room frustration. </p>\n<p>It was a casual one, I was asked if I work or study and about comedians in the first part. During the second part, the question was about a car journey I have made recently and the follow up conversations were about cars. Despite not being a fan of cars , I managed to give some goods answer to those questions. </p>\n<p>And it was the end of my test , I am now looking forward to the result. I am confident I will get  6 at minimum. However I will not be dismayed if I get a 7.5 or 8. As said Eminem, <em>Success is my only motherfuc**g option, failure is not.</em></p>\n<p>In the upcoming days, I will share my test results as well as my preparation strategy , so stay tunned for more content. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I sat for the IELTS today , here is how it went","date":"19 November, 2020","description":"As summary on how my english test was."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/ielts-how-it-went/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/some-projects-you-can-contribute-to-in-hackerfordev/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hacktoberfest is almost there, Python developers here are some venues for parties."}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/ci-cd-deploy-to-aws-github-actions/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Deploy a containerized python to AWS using Github Actions"}}}}}
