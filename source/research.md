I am currently doing my master and hope to put more on this section in the future, research exited me a lot but I am not currently thinking about doing a Phd.

If you're hosting me for a talk, [here](/images/me-offical-speaker.jpg) is my preferred profile image, and below is my speaker bio:


> I am Espoir Murhabazi Buzina, a Congolese software engineer with six years of experience in software engineering and data science.  
>I am currently a master's student in computer science at the University of Essex. I specialize in Natural Language Processing. I am passionate about text data and anything related to Natural Language Processing.
> My friend calls me *le grand Frere de ses petit freres* because I am passionate about mentoring young people and building the next generation of Congolese tech leaders. My dream is to train a thousand young Congolese software engineers and equip them with skills that will help them get remote jobs in top tech companies in the world in the next five years. I was awarded the Chevening Scholarship in 2021-22 for my community building and leadership skills.
