Plugged in

Besieged by opinion

disguised as true justified belief

wittled down

to 280 characters

Disassociated from the sense of 

paper & ponderous introspection

Supplanted by

a million voices reverberating

in a cavernous chamber

drowning in blind replies

talking at each other, but

mostly to the room

a million soapboxes

ingesting words as if picking sushi

from a conveyer belt

knowledge as an act of consumption
