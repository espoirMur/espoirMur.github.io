Let me do this and see where I will reach , Each day Leetcode will give an  algorithm challenge I will posting here the challenge and What I learned , hope I will complete the challenge.
Let do this .......

By the end of the challenge I should award myself with a [remarkable](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2) tablette if I complete 25 days of the challenge....

Let do this..

Day 1 :

Day one I learn a lot about bit manipulation.

The link to my submission can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/528/week-1/3283/#.XoRg3Tr_Tws.link)

Remaining days : 29

Day 2 :

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

This one was very difficult for me , it required a lot of thinking , I come up with a brute force approach but it didn't work at the first time.
It required some tricks

Day 3 : Maximum subarray problem 
Result : Failure....
I feel discouraged.... but I will not give up.

My solution pass 50 % of tests
tommorow if I get time I will come back to the wikipedia solution

Day 4 : Back to the winning streak I come with a working solution after few attempt.

It was similar to insertion sort algorithm.

Day 5 : I didn't even get intution on the solution

Day 6 : Back to the wining streak
https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/submissions/

Day 7 : 
Nothing done , the problem was difficult

Day 8 : Back to the winning streak with linked list, but again it was an easy problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/submissions/

Day 9 : This is a simple problem but lot  of folks comes up with simple solution

Day 10:

Day 10: 
Tree solution a simple problem .
I got the intuition but I was lazy to implement it.

Day 11:
Went back to the winning streak and everything was nice

Day 12: It was a medium problem but the solution didn't comes trought..

Day 13 : Solve the problem but it takes too long to get solved.

Day 15: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSRFtR3pv74

This problem, the intuition didn't comes, watched the videos and sound pretty easy , need to practice more on this....


Day 16 : Another medium level question, the intuition didn't come trought but manage to learn and read about recursion from it...

Day 17 : After Looking for a solution I gave up because time execepted but I will resume once I find time

Day 18 : Solved a meduim problem after trying it in 3 hours , 8 think today I should celebrate..

Day 19 : 
Solved another meduim proble

Day 20: Another meduim problem I solved before but this time I fail to find a solution

(subarray with sum equal K)

Day 26 : Worked on meduim problem about dynamic programing solve it and 
I worked , I learn a lot about dynamic programing .
