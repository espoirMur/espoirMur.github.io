I had been dreaming about visiting the Etihad Stadium one day in my life. When I first applied for the Chevening Scholarship, watching a Mancity game was one of the reasons why I wanted to come to the UK. 

I knew Boxing Day was a big day for the English Premier League, which is why I booked my ticket for the Manchester City against Leicester Game despite fear of postponement due to the new variant of COVID. 

I traveled from Colchester to Manchester on the 24th of December and, I booked my stay at the Britannica Hotel in the heart of Manchester Piccadilly. 

On the day of the game,  I took the bus to the Stadium. At first glimpse of the Stadium, I was in tears. My childhood dream became a reality. I was at the Etihad Stadium.

I arrived a bit late and missed the chance to have a full official Stadium tour. I still managed to visit the Stadium by myself later on, and took some nice pictures. 

### Meeting the legend  



Firstly, let's start with a bit of history. I have been supporting Manchester City since 2008 when I found that Vincent Kompany has some Congolese origin and comes from the same region as I. I wish I had the chance to meet him when he played for ManCity, but sadly he retired from professional football years ago. 

I have been a massive fan of him for his leadership on and off the pitch. I consider him my role model; therefore, I had to take my first picture of the day with his statue.

### The Dream come true 

Secondly, I went to the Stadium and took the picture that sums up my childhood dreams, Espoir in the UK.

### Cream on the cake, I watched a game live.

And Finally, before the game, I took another one to show people and everyone I have been watching football with in Goma, Bukavu, Kigali pubs that their friend and the only Manchester City fan they know has made it to the Stadium.

### Final result and FPL disappointments 

The game did end up well; we won 6-3; unfortunately, my FPL captain Phil Foden got only one point. I think this is the old FPL course. You_ should not captain a player you will be watching live. _

I wish I had the chance to catch the Canal + Broadcasting car to get a chance to pass on TV, but unfortunately, I couldnâ€™t find where the car was standing.

Now I can say that I finished my year in style. I hope to watch more games in the future and more importantly to catch the CANAL + car next time I visit the Stadium.
