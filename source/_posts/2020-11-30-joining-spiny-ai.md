After more than one year with countless job applications  and rejections, I am glad go announce you that I will be joining Spiny.ai as a Software Engineer !


I will be working closely with the data and machine learning team to build the next publishing Intelligence platforms.


It was not easy decision to take since I was already doing a good Job somewhere else but My need to growth and the offer they gave me were irresistible.

Despite COVID-19 this year was the best one for me career wise..


Specials thanks to Black-in-ai, I got the job from their platform, the Masakhane community and especially L’inamovible Jade Abott who played amazing role  in my academic and professional career !She is among my roles models and the people who shaped the person I am today! It was a pleasure to meet you.


I will also thanks everyone who helped me during this period.

After getting fired for a tweet from my last company ( I don’t want to cite them here) I had some months of depression but working hard , contributing to open source and pushing code to GitHub were  my treatments. After months of crisis I recovered . 

That is all, thanks for reading this, I will keep posting news updates from my role so stay tuned.
