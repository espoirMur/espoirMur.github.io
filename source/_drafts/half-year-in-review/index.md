It was one of those days after completing my daily standup  and I decided as usual to avoid and close noise and notification and all myn slack messages  to focus on some bugs I was facing .....

Two hours later when I open slack I found that fire was burning and I end up finding 6 unread messages..

Once I read the message I found that I made a big mistake ...
as a team lead I discovered that I gave a wrong estimation about the tasks I was working on and the manager got angry looks for me on slack and I was not online and from that anger he decided to demoted me from my leadership position and form the moment he decided to promoted my fellow engineer to the team lead position..

At some point I was happy to see a teammate I hired, trained an mentored being able to replace me..

From a teacher and mentor point of view it made me happy to see that I can make a teammate reach that position...

At another point is a failure from my side , how come after four years in this field I was not able to lead a team and handle communication perfectly with stake holder...

That incident reminds me that I still have a lot to work on on my communication...

At the end of the day I am always that guy to  whom everyone complains about his communication skills...

So am I the one who can not adapt to everyone communication style or it's everyone who cannot conform to my communication style? ðŸ¤”

In this blog post I am going to share some of the mistake I made in this year as well as something I should brag about this year..

The younger reader should find from it a list of thing he should avoid in his career and a more experienced person should find a time to share some wisdom with me...

one of the big mistake i did was  not to be able to ship the product I was working on on time and loose a one millions USD deal for the company I was working on and the mistake for itself could make me resign form my position ...

I miss first part of the year I should have at least completed and ship one personnal project live but however I was not able to ship somthing...

I decided to keep learning about NLP and kee and build an end to end data science project using NLP but on this area I also failed...

what else did I fail on?

I was not able to make a big habit of walking at 6 AM everyday and I end up loosing two  hours everydays by walking at 8am

I think I should stop talking about my mistake and open my brag document and talk about my wins this part of the year...


Okay we cannot talk about half of 2020 review without talking about the COVID-19 pandemic...

In the lock down time most of folks I know manage to discover Tiktk and made a lot of videos there but in the same time I  manage to solve 30 leetcode challenge in 60 days and keep a streal of leetcoding for 1 month...

Also I haven' get my job in that dream company but I think I am on the right track...


I failed to deliver my product I was working on but for the company I managed to build d a strong team of 3 developers and for now I can go on a leave and I will be sure my fellow brother will keep  doing my job very well...

although I got in trouble trying to learn nlp and rnn but I kept a 30  weeks streak reading about rnn and writing code for them


about reading in the first 6 month I read a life changing book about Atomic Habits by James Clear and that book changed a lot about my life.

I also read a boring books about effective execeutive althought I just completed it a half buut I learned a lot from it.

For now I am reading the best seller from dale carnegie and I  am learning still form it...
