With 4 days to go for FPL season and after more than 20 changes from my initial squad let me analyze my team.

## GoalKeepers:

**Fabiansky (Liverpool)**: I should expect some saves from him for the first game and check how He will perform for the next 3 fixtures


~~**Leno(Keep Him on the bench )**: Arsenal looks like they will concede against man city but should have more good fixtures to come.
A good history from Leverkusen.~~

### Update 2 days after 
 So I decide to go for **foster** instead of Leno(Because foster has good opening fixtures and I will be rotating him with Fabiansky) and I will spend .5 on a mid
## Defenders: 

**Mendy**: (Has a good form and has already recovered from last season injury ) I can expect assists form him and some clean sheets.

**Roberson**: Average of 5 points per match last season, a Guaranteed starter from Kloop So Can expect assists and Goals.
But For the coming days, I can swap him for Trippier or Clyne or Alexender-Arnold.

**van Aanholt**: Good last season and has also a good pre-season should expect some goals and assist from him:
But should keep an eye on Coleman from Everton or Baines.

**Cédric**: He is a bargain for 4.5£ I could get some points from him.

**Wan-Bissaka**: To complete my squad, he starts in most of Crystal palace friendlies games until I find others options for 4£

## Middlefielder and Atatck
 First of all I took the hard decision to in the opposite direction and try to play with differentials for the first 3 gameweeks , in case of necessity i will get back to him in gameweek 4 or after playing my first wildcard.

###  Middlefield
 **Jota** : for his form with wolves in the championship last season: here are his stats: 17 goals 5 assists.
 
 **Bernardo Silva**: Has a good pre-season but not a long-term option with sterling and Marhez recovering.
 **Mane** : Without salah in my FPL, I need a god Middlefield from Liverpool and he is my second choice but will keep an eye on shakiri.
 **Sanchez** : the 2016/2017 season he spent with arsenal shows that he is a good choice for FPL, and as Lukaku is still recovering from worldcup, he will going to play number 9 on man u attack. I bet on him.
 **Schurlle** : Yes the super sub from Fulham, he will stat on my bench but let wait and see if he can grab some minutes.
 
 ### Attack :
 
 **Aguero**: I cannot afford to play FPL without either Aguero or Kane but as Kane is still recovering let play with the Kun... but Aubameyang preseason give me doubts about this choice.
 
 **Arnautovic**: God preseason with Westham (but Zaha could also play but still in a dilemma) 
 **Tosun**: he also had a good preseason
