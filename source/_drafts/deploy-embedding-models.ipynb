    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a Data Scientist who has finally trained a  machine-learning model in a jupyter notebook. The model works fine, and you are happy with your results. Now you want to expose it to the users so that they can interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have different options to serve your model to your users. You can use the jupyter notebook directly in production. You can wrap the model in a pickle file and serve it using an API. Both options work, but can they handle millions of requests per second in a production environment? In this post, I will show how you can use modern tools to deploy an embedding model in a scalable way.  We'll use the ONNX runtime, Triton inference server, and Kubernetes. These tools will help us to deploy  a production-ready language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data scientists and language engineer researchers aiming to use their models in production should read this. It discusses the engineering principles of scalable embedding APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be divided into two parts. In the first part, we will prepare the model for a production setting. We will use the ONNX runtime and Docker container to achieve that goal. Finally,  in the second part, we will learn how to scale our Apis using Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I have time later, I'll explain how to use the embedding API in a  downstream app  like a Retrieval Augmentation Generation RAG. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the deployment bits of this application, let us first review what embeddings are.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Find a picture here]\n",
    "## Embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding models are the backbone of generative AI. They are a major piece of such applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are representations of words in a vector space. They capture words semantics such as, with them, similar vectors represent similar words. \n",
    "\n",
    " Contextual embeddings are embeddings such as each word is represented with a vector given its context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at those two examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "_The bank of the river Thames is located in south London._\n",
    "\n",
    "_I am going to withdraw cash at Lloyds Bank._\n",
    "\n",
    "In those two different sentences the word `bank` has two different meanings. In the first,  bank means _the land alongside or sloping down to a river or lake._ In the second sentence, it means _a place where you save money._\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding models can capture those differences. And  represent words with two different vectors according to the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a post to explain how embedding models are built, if you want to learn more about them refer to [this post.](https://mccormickml.com/2019/05/14/BERT-word-embeddings-tutorial/)\n",
    "\n",
    "But one thing to know is that embedding models are built with language models or Large language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Add A Picture of Embeddings here]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Large Language Models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models are neural networks or probabilistic models that can predict the next word given the previous words.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common neural network architectures to power language models is the transformer model. It was introduced in 2017 by Google researchers. Those models have a powerful capacity when to comes to understanding words and their meanings. Because they are trained on a large corpus of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "During their training, transformers' models can learn contextual word embedding.  Those embeddings are useful in downstream applications such as chatbots, document classification, topic modeling, document clustering  et consort..\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this post is not about language models, there  are legions on the internet, my favorite one is the  [illustrated trasnfomer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/).\n",
    "\n",
    "If this post is not about word embedding theory, or large language model theory what is it about?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nice question, this post is about deploying a large language model. We will learn how to create an embedding service, a api that developers can query to generate document embedding. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will build a scalable API. Developers can query it to get word embeddings of their sentences. They can use the embeddings in downstream applications. This API can be part of a chatbot, or a Retrieval Augmented Generation application.\n",
    "\n",
    "I made it for educational purposes while learning how to deploy a language model using Kubernetes.  If you want a production-ready application that can support multiple embedding models  [checkout.](https://github.com/jina-ai/clip-as-service)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we will learn how to deploy a transformer model that generates embedding vectors on Kubernetes using the triton inference server and the ONNX runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enough talking let's show us the code!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The embedding models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we will explore the embedding model generated by the BioLinkBert. The bioLinkBert model is a model from the BERT family but it was fine-tuned on documents from the medical domain. The reason I used the Biolink model is that I want to build a chatbot application for the medical domain in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding of words is the last hidden state of a transformer model where the output is the word encoded as text. Let us see how it works  in practice. We will be using a custom Bert model which inherits the base Bert model from Huggingface.\n",
