In one line: I am in between Software Engineering and Data Science. 🧐

By Day:  You will find me fine-tuning language models task for my MSc project and any natural language processing task I am working on, or just getting lost in complicated equations of Probabilistic Machine Learning. 🎓

By Night: I am deploying code for spiny.ai. I do anything with python, pivoting pandas dataframe to do data analysis, cooking celery on Aws Kubernetes clusters to deploy our code, firing an API with Flask or FastApi, or arguing with my teammates about the best variable names to use for our codebase. 🤪

On Weekends: When I am not coding, you can find me supporting manchester city, tweaking my fantasy premier league team, or just moving around nightclubs in Uk and enjoying live music.🦈

Fun fact: I have never thought that saying that I am the firstborn in my family and having nine siblings from the same mum would be my fun fact one day.👨‍👩‍👧‍👦😉
