My name is Jade. 

By day, I am an NLP engineer at [Retro Rabbit](retrorabbit.co.za) where I build all kinds of things. I was once dubbed as “Full-stack ML” because I’ve worked at every end of putting a ML model into production - from wrangling the data, to training the models, to deploying and scaling in production, to adding results to the database, and repeating the cycle over and over - with a focus on data ops and devops.

By night, I lead [Masakhane](masakhane.io), a grassroots open research movement for NLP for African languages. I am extremely passionate about changing the way Africa and Africans are currently percieved by the Western world. I wish to empower the world by empowering Africans from all walks of life to participate in the global conversation.

In-between, I [tweet](twitter.com/alienelf) extensively and angrily.

And sometimes, I take that anger out [musically](fmfy.bandcamp.com)
