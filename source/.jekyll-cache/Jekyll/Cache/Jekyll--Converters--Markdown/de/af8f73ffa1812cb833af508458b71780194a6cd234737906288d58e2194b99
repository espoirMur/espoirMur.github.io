I"£<p>Recently at work, we decided to build a CI/CD pipeline that deploys our application directly to AWS. I had never worked with AWS, and it was a missing point on my CV which demonstrates that I have some DevOps skills. I decided to search for some tutorials online and I was not lucky to get what we needed at work. I decided to write this guide by getting something working from various tutorials I found online.</p>
