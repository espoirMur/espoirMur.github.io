I"ý<p>After more than one year with countless job applications  and rejections, I am glad go announce you that I will be joining Spiny.ai as a Software Engineer !</p>

<p>I will be working closely with the data and machine learning team to build the next publishing Intelligence platforms.</p>

<p>It was not easy decision to take since I was already doing a good Job somewhere else but My need to growth and the offer they gave me were irresistible.</p>

<p>Despite COVID-19 this year was the best one for me career wise..</p>

<p>Specials thanks to Black-in-ai, I got the job from their platform, the Masakhane community and especially Lâ€™inamovible Jade Abott who played amazing role  in my academic and professional career !She is among my roles models and the people who shaped the person I am today! It was a pleasure to meet you.</p>

<p>I will also thanks everyone who helped me during this period.</p>

<p>After getting fired for a tweet from my last company ( I donâ€™t want to cite them here) I had some months of depression but working hard , contributing to open source and pushing code to GitHub were  my treatments. After months of crisis I recovered .</p>

<p>That is all, thanks for reading this, I will keep posting news updates from my role so stay tuned.</p>
