</ul>

<p>Talk I need to attend to this year :</p>

<p>PyCon Africa
Data Science Africa
Deep learning Indaba
NeurIps… Only if I finished the deep learning project on time</p>

<p>I have 2 free days in a week, One should be algorithms and Data Structure and Another one for another one for Data Science And NLP</p>

<p>Another 3 days will be concentrated to work !</p>

<p>And weekend will be to catch up with what I didn’t completed</p>

<p>Day 1 of Reccurent Neural Network :</p>

<p>Materials so hard from fast.ai , a lot abstraction , Did I miss the basics or ?
Is their approach which is not good for me? Or the because their code is not pythonic? may be</p>

<p>Let me try dl2.ai course and check how it will goes</p>

<p>The book looks great but it could be better to combine both on next time</p>

<p>Or combine it with MIT deep learning</p>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njKP3FqW3Sk&amp;list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI</p>

<p>Another resources</p>

<p>Day One of DS and Algorithm with Java::</p>

<p>Everything went well get understand the first 45 minutes</p>

<p>Will resume tomorrow :</p>

<p>Keep it up…</p>

<p>Day 2 of recurrent neural network everything went smoothly, I watched the video about RNN 
Got the intuition , read the book, got some intuition but got stuck on the data preparation part , that is where I will start on Monday</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will resume with DS and Algorithms</p>

<p>Day 2 DS and Algorithms Union Find Algorithm Implementation</p>

<p>Things are not going to the peace I want but a least I found useful resources to use .</p>

<p>Day 3 of RNN at least some progress where made:
I learned about word embedding and preprocessing text and how we do world representation.
I didn’t get everything at 100 % but I made some progress.</p>

<p>Day 3 of DS and algorithm :</p>

<p>One good step in the right direction but things are not moving fast.</p>

<p>I found one video, went on implementing it and things seems to go well</p>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz-K8HLkzeM</p>

<p>Day 4 of RNN:</p>

<p>Another good progress was made, I manage to understand the shape of the input and the output
next is to check how we load data and the random sampling thing and perplexity</p>

<p>Day 4 of Ds and Algorithm</p>

<p>I am failing on this java thing and it’s taking me so much time to work with java, learning..
Should I give up???</p>

<p>Day 5 : The goal is to prepare the text RNN
Follow the tutorial and understand almost everything about text processing
it goes well, done with the tutorial, finally I managed to prepare data for training a simple RNN , the word embedding stuff still confusing me…</p>

<p>But I will do something…</p>

<p>Day 6 of RNN :</p>

<p>Today , it was not like yesterday, I found myself lost and not training my neural network, I need more info and to make this done.. at least I should make the forward pass.</p>

<p>Failure at 3 Pm : spend a lot time without understanding the input</p>

<p>Need to come back</p>

<p>Day 7 of RNN:</p>

<p>Thing start getting clear and understood the input shapes except one thing, why the hidden state need to have where comes the dimension of the hiden state?</p>

<p>https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/whirlwind-tour-of-rnns-a11effb7808f</p>

<p>Day 8 : I review cross entropy function and learn how to apply it .
The main question was how to apply it for RNN what is the correct class label at a given time step</p>

<p>Day 9 : The light about the correct label at each step comes now I am able to continue, let us get blocked again into BPTT
BPTT the intuition was well understood via a good video and I understand the problem of vanishing gradient and exploding gradient.
The next step is to implement BPTT</p>

<p>Day 10 : Implementing BPTT from scratch: Ehhehheehe again other problem will start 
should I thing I should start from implementing backward propagation and then move to BPTT 
Let take the Coming 2 days to implement Backward propagation using ANN
Then I will get back to LSTM</p>

<p>Day 11 RNN : Implementing Forward propagation for ANN and architecture, got bored at the moment when I should calculate the backward propagation for RNN, I will get back to this later tomorrow.</p>

<p>DAY 12 RNN : Backward propagation , what is wrong with this? is it the code or me trying to learn…</p>

<p>Should I get back to the basics or ?</p>

<p>Day 13 RNN : Went back to the basics, read <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html">this chapter</a> and things start getting clear, 
I think I have enough information to compelete coding bp from scratch
Today the intutinion comes an I manage to develop a good intution, tommorow I will check other approach and plot results with graphs</p>

<p>Day 14 RNN : Train the model, but the accuracy is increasing instead of decreasing, need to learn more about his
it’s decreasing but not in the right way…</p>

<p>Day 15 RNN : Lost track but let me get back today.</p>

<p>Day 16 RNN: Back to the code…
The previous implementation was not wrong at all, it gives me an intuition on how backward propagation works in details now, I need to go back to RNN to discover things by myself.
I will have to write it with pen and paper and implement it.</p>

<p>Day 17 : What did I do, I seems to understand the equation of BPTT now tomorow I will try to implement it with code</p>

<p>Day 18 : Went back to the math of BPTT and learn something but distractions was to many today, I didn’t finished what I started !</p>

<p>Day 19 : Math equations drive me crazy end up opening almost 10 taps, end up in a wrong tutorials not explaining the things in a right way.</p>

<p>Will come back tommorow , let me take a break</p>

<p>https://kharshit.github.io/blog/2019/02/22/backpropagation-through-time</p>

<p>And this</p>

<p>https://github.com/go2carter/nn-learn/blob/master/grad-deriv-tex/rnn-grad-deriv.pdf</p>

<p>Day 20 :</p>

<p>The derivates become clear after many research from other sources
but the pdf is now understandable</p>

<p>Next step tommorow will be to update the fork and post it, contribute to research.</p>

<p>https://kharshit.github.io/blog/2019/02/22/backpropagation-through-time</p>

<p>https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/238496/why-back-propagate-through-time-in-a-rnn
Day 21 :
Finally updated the questions and contribute to research , the last step will be to resume the algo implementation</p>

<p>Day 22 : 
We get back where we left , and I am glad I found self explanatory results about RNN from scratch I will start from them.</p>

<p>Day 23 : Nothing done today, I feel bored , unmotivated….  A day to forget….</p>

<p>Dat 24: Looks like I lost track, after spending 2 days without checking my code, I got lost in the equations</p>

<p>Day 25: Manage to train my model and the accuracy was decreasing but I am keep getting weird results, I will check them tommorow but at least I am on a right track.</p>

<p>Find another OOP blog post , I will give it a try tommorow.
https://github.com/pangolulu/rnn-from-scratch</p>

<p>Day 27 :</p>

<p>Finally trained my model and get good result, and that was awesome I should celebrate ….</p>

<p>Refractor the code using python data science cookie cutter and.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I can start doing some predictions with it…</p>

<p>Day 28:</p>

<p>I got blocked on something related to predictions, I asked a question on stack exchange , I got something I will be reviewing it tommorow</p>
