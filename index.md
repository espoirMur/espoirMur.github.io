## Hi! 

My name is Jade Abbott. I am a machine learning engineer at [Retro Rabbit](http://retrorabbit.co.za/) where I build all kinds of things. These days I work on various ends of NLP-related projects, which are my passion. I was once dubbed as "Full-stack ML" because I've worked at every end of putting a ML model into production - from wrangling the data, to training the models, to deploying and scaling in production, to adding results to the database, and repeating the cycle over and over - with a focus on data ops and devops. I currently do that for start-up [Kalido](https://www.kalido.me/).

My passions are:
- Natural Language Processing
- Machine Learning (All kinds! Deep, shallow, unsupervised, etc)
- Software Engineering
- Music (I make bass noises for [Follow Me Follow You](http://fmfy.bandcamp.com))

I consider myself a polyglot and obsessively learn about new shiny things and try figure out what's wrong with them. My current fave languages are golang and python. I like to comment about people's misuse of technology they think is cool, but really is useless.

In the evenings, I become a machine learning researcher with a particular focus on machine translation for African languages. I am extremely passionate about changing the way Africa and Africans are currently percieved by the Western world. I wish to empower the world by empowering Africans from all walks of life to participate in the global conversation. 

## This Blog

I decided to start this blog, because as much as I love Medium as a platform for exploration, it can suffer from the same clutter as other social media platforms. [Sebastian Ruder's blog](http://ruder.io/) is the inspiration for creating my own.

Until I've ported all my posts, you might want to check out my [Medium](https://medium.com/@alienelf).
