Let me do this and see where I will reach , Each day Leetcode will give an  algorithm challenge I will posting here the challenge and What I learned , hope I will complete the challenge.
Let do this .......

By the end of the challenge I should award myself with a [remarkable](https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2) tablette if I complete 25 days of the challenge....

Let do this..

Day 1 :

Day one I learn a lot about bit manipulation.

The link to my submission can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/528/week-1/3283/#.XoRg3Tr_Tws.link)

Remaining days : 29

Day 2 :

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

This one was very difficult for me , it required a lot of thinking , I come up with a brute force approach but it didn't work at the first time.
It required some tricks

Day 3 : Maximum subarray problem 
Result : Failure....
I feel discouraged.... but I will not give up.

My solution pass 50 % of tests
tommorow if I get time I will come back to the wikipedia solution

Day 4 : Back to the winning streak I come with a working solution after few attempt.

It was similar to insertion sort algorithm.
