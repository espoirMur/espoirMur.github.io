description: "Thing I need to get done"
---

I hate new year resolution , instead I go with 100 days sprints.

This list contains things I need to get done before end of the first hundred days of this year.

I started the sprint on february 1st 2020 , and I will check up on it end of April where I am.

Things I need to get done In the first 100 days of 2020

- [ ] Completed and deploy and end to end personal project
- [ ] Start and Learn Recurrent Neural Network from Scratch
- [ ] Use  it in an End to End Project (Predicting Blog post Tags)
- [ ] Write 3 blogs post 
- [ ] Learning about recommendations systems and write a blog post 
- [ ] Organize a hackathons for all Congolese leaving in Kigali
- [ ] Put 3 baselines models for Congolese languages on masakhane
- [ ] Finish one blog
- [ ] migrate the old blog to the new one and set up google analytic ans SEO
- [ ] Complete the 2 course of Algorithms and Data Structure from Coursera


Talk I need to attend to this year :

Pycon Africa
Data Science Africa
Deep learning Indaba
NeurIps... Only if I finished the deep learning project on time


I have 2 free days in a week, One should be algorithms and Data Structure and Another one for another one for Data Science And NLP


Another 3 days will be concentrated to work !

And weekend will be to catch up with what I didn't completed


Day 1 of Reccurent Neural Network :

Materials so hard from fast.ai , a lot abstraction , Did I miss the basics or ?
Is their approach which is not good for me? Or the because their code is not pythonic? may be

Let me try dl2.ai course and check how it will goes

The book looks great but it could be better to combine both on next time

Or combine it with MIT deep learning

Another resources

Day One of DS and Algorithm with Java::

Everything went well get understand the first 45 minutes

Will resume tomorrow :

Keep it up...

Day 2 of recurrent neural network everything went smoothly, I watched the video about RNN 
Got the intuition , read the book, got some intuition but got stuck on the data preparation part , that is where I will start on Monday

Tomorrow I will resume with DS and Algorithms

Day 2 DS and Algorithms Union Find Algorithm Implementation

Things are not going to the peace I want but a least I found useful resources to use .

Day 3 of RNN at least some progress where made:
I learned about word embedding and preprocessing text and how we do world representation.
I didn't get everything at 100 % but I made some progress.


Day 3 of DS and algorithm :

One good step in the right direction but things are not moving fast.

I found one video, went on implementing it and things seems to go well

Day 4 of RNN:

Another good progress was made, I manage to understand the shape of the input and the output
next is to check how we load data and the random sampling thing and perplexity


Day 4 of Ds and Algorithm

I am failing on this java thing and it's taking me so much time to work with java, learning..
Should I give up???
