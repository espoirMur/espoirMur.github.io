# Hacktoberfest is almost there , Python developers here are some venues for parties 

This year has been an amazing year for me because I got time to contribute to some open source project and had my pull request merged on  amazing projects with many stars , and it help me to put some green dot on my github profile..

I don't want to brag about my open source contribution which are very small comparing to what have been done in the open source community , but I want to show you which open source project you can contribute to during this period, to get those green dot on  your github profile so that when a recruiter ask you for some sample of your work you can have something to show him. 

## But why October? 

The reason why I wrote this post today it's because we are in October which is the open source month. DigitalOcean in partnership with dev.to organize [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) , the most exciting open source festival where people got the opportunity to contribute to open source and get some swags  and other awards for recognition ..
