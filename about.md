## Hi! 

My name is Jade Abbott. I am a senior software developer at [Retro Rabbit](http://retrorabbit.co.za/) where I build all kinds of things. These days I work on various ends of NLP-related projects, which are my passion. I was once dubbed as "Full-stack ML" because I've worked at every end of putting a ML model into production - from wrangling the data, to training the models, to deploying and scaling in production, to adding results to the database, and repeating the cycle over and over - with a focus on data ops and devops. I currently do that for start-up [Kalido](https://www.kalido.me/).

My passions are:
- Machine Learning (All kinds! Deep, shallow, unsupervised, etc)
- Software Engineering
- Natural Language Processing
- Music (I make bass noises for [Follow Me Follow You](http://fmfy.bandcamp.com))

I consider myself a polyglot and obsessively learn about new shiny things and try figure out what's wrong with them. My current fave languages are golang and python. I like to comment about people's misuse of technology they think is cool, but really is useless.


## This Blog

I decided to start this blog, because as much as I love Medium as a platform for exploration, it can suffer from the same clutter as other social media platforms. [Sebastian Ruder's blog](http://ruder.io/) is the inspiration for creating my own.

Until I've ported all my posts, you might want to check out my [Medium](https://medium.com/@alienelf).

## Talks

I like sharing info, so often try out stupid tech things and talk about them:

- [Machine Learning in Real Life ~ 2018](https://za.pycon.org/talks/23-machine-learning-in-real-life/)
- [How to Build an Artificial John Lennon ~ 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHkW-w2wOhA&t=607s)
- [How to train an AI to generate Album Covers ~ 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uul7rir4X1k)
- [Deep Dreams of Electric Sheep ~ 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbXMsDOyQfU)
- [How to even process natural language ~ 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzt4Nkpr6hs)

## Publications

I've had quite a back-and-forth journey with research, trying to learn what excites me most. It has Here are a couple of my assorted published works. Expect many more on the way :)
